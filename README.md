# bbg

bbg is the Backend Boilerplate Generator, or more informally the "BackBoneGenie" that would grant your wishs of offloading any boilerplate code taking countless hours of wasted effort and backbone health by streamlining the process of easily-customisable code generation, it is an ambitious project that is still in the very early design phase, it currently is severely limited by being built around a subset of python's flask framework's ecosystem, but is planned to be much more generalised (and more importantly extensible) for consumption by backend developers in any framework for any language.
